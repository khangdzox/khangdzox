### 👋 Hi there

I'm a last year student at **Le Quy Don high school for the gifted** in [Da Nang, Viet Nam](https://goo.gl/maps/5LQC8v8eGrWtxXr5A). I have a passion for software and game development, so i started to study C++ and Python few years ago by myself. I also have some experiences in engineering and coding with Arduino. This place is where I save and develop my projects to practice coding.
