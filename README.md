### 👋 Hi there

I'm a student learning Computer Science at **Swinburne University of Technology**. I have a passion for software and game development, and also artificial intelligence, so i started to study C++ and Python few years ago by myself. I also have some experiences in engineering and coding with Arduino. This place is where I save and develop my projects to practice coding.
